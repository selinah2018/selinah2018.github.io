# Selina's Sandbox

Here you can find the repository for her [GitHub Page](https://selinah2018.github.io/). 

She primarily uses this area to test and explore proof of concepts. Currently she is experimenting with different ways of presenting information in a chatbot window. 

Chatbot has become increasingly popular due to its convenience and modern day lifestyle. Some people prefer talking to a chatbot to find simple information; however, chatbot’s abilities shouldn’t be limited to just showing textual information in a text bubble. 

Chatbots are the connecting point between user and his/her answers. The way this information is presented can greatly influence the user’s experience. For example, when a user requests a document, allowing the user to see the document in the chat window directly, instead of showing a URL, can let the user immediately determine if the document is what he/she is looking for. This removes the need for the user to open a new tab to see that the document is incorrect and then returning to the original tab to ask the question again. 

There are endless possibilities to present information and that is what she is trying to test and experiment in this repository.
